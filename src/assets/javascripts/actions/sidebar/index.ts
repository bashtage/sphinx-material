/**
 * Set sidebar height
 *
 * This function doesn't set the height of the actual sidebar, but of its first
 * child â€“ the `.md-sidebar__scrollwrap` element in order to mitigiate jittery
 * sidebars when the footer is scrolled into view. At some point we switched
 * from `absolute` / `fixed` positioning to `sticky` positioning, significantly
 * reducing jitter in some browsers (respectively Firefox and Safari) when
 * scrolling from the top. However, top-aligned sticky positioning means that
 * the sidebar snaps to the bottom when the end of the container is reached.
 * This is what leads to the mentioned jitter, as the sidebar's height may be
 * updated too slowly.
 *
 * This behaviour can be mitigiated by setting the height of the sidebar to `0`
 * while preserving the padding, and the height on its first element.
